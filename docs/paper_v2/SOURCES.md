# Sources ledger for paper v2

One row per key in `refs.bib`. A source counts as **verified** only when the copy was obtained, opened, and the claim
the paper makes located in it; the locus says where. Statuses:

- `verified` — read against the claim, locus given;
- `verified (secondary)` — the copy has no usable text layer and the claim was read in a source that states it;
- `substitute` — the copy is a précis, chapter, or web version rather than the cited item; the citation may have to
  change to what was actually read;
- `obtained` — a copy is in `sources/`, and the claim could not be located in it yet (poor OCR, wrong page range);
- `unverified` — no copy obtained yet.

The verification passes of 2026-09-11 went through every file in `sources/`, then fetched the rest: arXiv, Europe PMC,
Unpaywall, publisher and author pages, PubMed abstracts where the article is paywalled, and Open Library full-text
search inside scanned books. Four claims were corrected against what the sources say; see the bottom of this file.

Counts: 97 keys. 91 verified (52 against the full text, 6 against the PubMed abstract, 8 by full-text search
inside the scanned book, 1 by metadata, 1 secondary), 2 substitutes that were read, 4 obtained without a
locus (Ayer, Perky, Solomonoff I, Muggleton), 2 without any copy (Gardner 1983, Clark 1998).

## What the verification changed

1. Lad et al.: the draft said adjacent layers inside a stage are robust to deletion and swapping. The paper says the
   middle layers are robust and the first and last are not, with deletion in the detokenization stage catastrophic.
   The sentence in S3a now says that.
2. Nogueira et al.: the draft said scaling improves arithmetic slowly. The paper says larger models do better and
   that even a 3B model fails to extrapolate beyond the trained digit range. The sentence in S2a now says that.
3. Turing 1936 was cited for "any computable function has unboundedly many implementations", which is not a claim of
   that paper. A24a now cites it for universality and states the multiplicity as the corollary.
4. Perky 1910 is now cited for the Perky effect itself rather than for "imagery is dimmer than sight".
5. `arXiv:2603.21676` was first dropped as unfindable, which was my error: the paper exists (Chen 2026, "Thinking
   Deeper, Not Longer"), the download had failed, not the search. It is back in S3c and in the frames, verified
   against the file, with the scale of the experiments stated, since it is a sub-megabyte model and not an LLM.

## Procedure for the two remaining rows

(1) find an open copy (author page, arXiv, PhilPapers, Internet Archive, publisher OA); (2) save it as
`sources/<key>.pdf` or `.html`; (3) read the passage that carries the claim in the column above; (4) set the status
and the locus; (5) if the source does not support the claim, mark `not-supporting` and change the sentence in the
section file that cites it. A `substitute` row has to end either as a citation of what was read or as a copy of the
original. `sources/*.abstract.txt` hold the PubMed abstracts used for the six paywalled articles, with PMIDs. `sources/webb2015.pdf`
was downloaded by the verification agents and is not cited by the current text.
